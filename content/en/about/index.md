<p>At Singular Movement, we have our eyes set on an ambitious goal: to teach athletes on the internet how to move better and perform at their best. We develop strength & conditioning educational content and web applications to accomplish this. Dave Pratt DPT, OCS, CSCS founded the company in 2021 -- right after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic lockdowns and restrictions -including the closing of gyms - highlighted the need for affordable, robust web services to help athletes improve their fitness anytime, anywhere. Singular Movement aspires to fill that need.</p>
