<p>The human body often develops muscular tightness patterns, leading to suboptimal posture and joint active range of
    motion (AROM). These asymmetries occur for various reasons, such as improper body mechanics, previous injuries, and
    overuse patterns. There are numerous methods to correct these muscular tightness patterns, but one is superior to
    the rest. </p>
<p>The most common tactic to improve AROM is static stretching. Physical Education classes in the US traditionally teach
    students to stretch before and after exercise statically, so this tends to be the go-to method for most Americans.
    The evidence is mixed regarding if it significantly enhances flexibility, reduces the risk of injury, or improves
    joint passive range of motion (PROM).<sup>1</sup> However, it's well established that a standard static stretching
    regimen
    does not significantly improve AROM. </p>
<p>Strength & Conditioning specialists and clinicians (e.g., physical therapists, occupational therapists) use other
    more-advanced techniques to improve AROM and flexibility, such as proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation (PNF)
    stretching. Clinicians trained in the Mulligan Concept -- created by Brian R. Mulligan -- perform mobilizations with
    the movement of the extremities and SNAGS (sustained natural apophyseal glides) of the spine. The literature
    demonstrates that these techniques effectively improve AROM. </p>
<p>Another common strategy to improve flexibility and AROM is a generic, or sport-specific, dynamic warm-up routine. The
    primary intent of a dynamic warm-up before sport or exercise is to increase blood flow, improve tissue
    extensibility, decrease joint fluid viscosity, and enhance neuromuscular control.<sup>2</sup> The literature
    indicates that a dynamic warm-up session can significantly reduce injury risk during sporting events and produce
    short-term improvements in vertical jump height, long-jump distance, and sprinting output compared to
    static stretching.<sup>3,4</sup></p>
<p>It is well established that a dynamic warm-up is superior to static stretching for short-term improvements in AROM.
    However, a generic dynamic warm-up has two limitations. First, the benefits are typically short-lived. Improvements
    in AROM do not last more than a few hours. Second, it does not sufficiently address AROM, flexibility, and
    performance limitations that stem from regional interdependence (RI) deficits.</p>
<p>Regional interdependence is a clinical model popularized in the physical and occupational therapy professions, with
    an underlying premise that remote and seemingly unrelated areas of the body have a powerful and direct effect on the
    body region of chief concern (e.g., most pronounced AROM limitation).<sup>5</sup> A clinical example would be a
    hip's soft tissue restriction or joint hypomobility, causing reduced AROM of the contralateral shoulder. In this
    example, improving the mobility of the impaired hip would immediately and significantly enhance the AROM of the
    contralateral shoulder. </p>
<p>The RI approach is a cornerstone of the Singular Movement Mobility App. The application's algorithm generates
    exercise recommendations to improve the limited motions by systematically mobilizing other body regions. The goal is
    to optimize the user's dynamic center of gravity, enhancing their gross AROM. </p>
<p>Systemically mobilizing unrestricted body regions works because of two mechanisms. First, it helps balance the
    biotensegrity of the user's body -- learn more about this topic from our premium article "Biotensegrity and
    Myofascial Lines." Second, it uses the cross-activation method to normalize tissue tension.</p>
<p>The cross-activation method entails improving the mobility of one body region by mobilizing the unimpaired
    contralateral side. The current literature has demonstrated that unilateral strength and mobility training
    positively affect the untrained opposite limb.<sup>6</sup> This phenomenon is known as cross-activation. We believe
    the primary mechanism of this to be the ability of the central nervous system to use the motor control pattern
    established through training one limb and applying it to the contralateral limb. Cross-activation typically results
    in immediate improvements in the AROM of the contralateral extremity. </p>
<p>The app must know which bodily motions are limited to use these two mechanisms effectively. Therefore, the
    application first instructs the user to perform a group of 12 movements. The user must then rate the movement from 0
    to 100. The higher the score, the more challenging the movement is. For a more detailed explanation of scoring the
    movements, read our free article "Mobility Application: User's Guide." </p>
<p>Then, the application will suggest which of the 12 movements should be the first exercise for the user. The user will
    perform that exercise and then rerate the more-challenging movements. The application will use the new scores to
    make future exercise recommendations. The goal is to lower the scores of all 12 movements during an exercise
    session. From our experience, it does a great job of doing this. Once those 12 movements are all satisfactory, the
    app will have the user progress to a group of 12 more challenging movements. </p>
<p>Users must note that this app is not to be used to treat injuries or significant physical impairments. Only
    individuals cleared to participate in general exercise programs by their primary care physician or advanced practice
    provider (e.g., nurse practitioner, physician assistant) should use this application. The sole goal of the app is to
    empower users to improve their gross mobility inexpensively, conveniently, and safely. For more information on using
    the app, please read our free article "Singular Movement Mobility Application: User's Guide." </p>
