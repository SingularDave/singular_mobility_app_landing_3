<p>We designed the Singular Movement Mobility App to help its users improve their gross mobility inexpensively,
  conveniently, and safely. This app's exercise sessions are great for stand-alone mobility workouts and pre-workout
  warmups-- such as before running or resistance training.</p>
<p>No special or expensive equipment is required to perform a session with this app. Users only need to wear comfortable
  unrestricted clothing and comfortable shoes and access a chair without wheels and a wall to complete a workout. That's
  it.</p>
<p>Users must note that this app is not to be used to treat injuries or significant physical impairments. A primary care
  physician or advanced practice provider (e.g., nurse practitioner, physician assistant) should clear any individual to
  participate in a general exercise program before using this app. </p>
<p>For a detailed explanation of the reasoning for the exercise methods used by the app, please read the article
  "Singular Movement Mobility Application: Overview" in the free article section. </p>
<p>Steps for Using the Singular Movement Mobility App:</p>
<ol>
  <li>You must read and agree to the user's agreement before using the app.</li>
  <li>The app will first instruct you to perform a group of 12 similar movements. Each group will include upper body,
    trunk, and lower body movements. You will need to rate these movements based on their difficulty.
  </li>
  <li>You must rate the difficulty of each movement from 0 to 100. The higher the number, the more challenging the
    movement was. It would help if you considered all aspects of the movement. The more effort the motion took to
    perform, the higher the number should be. The tighter or stiffer the motion felt, the higher the rating. If the move
    was uncomfortable, that should increase the score. Again, consider all of these aspects when you rate the motion. A
    0-30 indicates the movement was mildly difficult. A score of 30-70 means it was moderately difficult, and a score
    over 70 is significantly difficult.
  </li>
  <li>If all of the scores for a group are low, the app will have you test a new more-challenging group of movements. If
    all of the scores are high, it will have you try a less-challenging group of motions. If the group has a mix of good
    and bad moves, you'll work on that group during the session. You'll receive your first exercise from that group of
    motions you just tested.
  </li>
  <li>You'll perform your first exercise. If you feel discomfort or excessive fatigue while performing the exercise,
    indicate it by checking the appropriate box. We designed the app's algorithm to maximize your results for each
    session without excessively fatiguing you or giving you discomfort. You must indicate if you're experiencing
    discomfort or excessive fatigue. Stop performing the workout if you experience any pronounced pain or other
    unexpected symptoms. Contact a physician if your symptoms are more severe than expected with general exercise.
  </li>
  <li>After completing your first exercise, the app will ask you to retest movements that initially had a score > 30.
  </li>
  <li>The app will then give you the following exercise recommendation.</li>
  <li>The app will have you complete no more than two exercises in a workout. However, the app could instruct you to
    perform many sets of an exercise, including performing the same exercise at various speeds (e.g., slow, fast,
    holding at end range).
  </li>
  <li>After performing two exercises, the app could have you finish the workout with a self-massage technique if you did
    not improve all the tested movements sufficiently. You can find the reasoning for the self-massage by reading our
    premium article "Biotensegrity and Myofascial Lines."
  </li>
  <li>The workout will end once all of your movement scores are good, or you have completed two exercises and a
    self-massage technique.
  </li>
  <li>Each workout typically takes 10-20 minutes on average.</li>
  <li>We recommend that individuals perform this workout at least once per day, but no more than thrice.</li>
